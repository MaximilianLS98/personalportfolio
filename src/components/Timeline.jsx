                        <p>
                            I undertook a Bootcamp to become a full-stack consultant at <a href="https://www.salt.study">SALT</a>.
                            This is where my passion and understanding for programming really took off.
                            During the bootcamp I got experience working with a wide range of technologies, as well as people.
